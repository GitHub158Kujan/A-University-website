The front-end project I've created is a university website clone, built exclusively with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This replication mirrors the design and functionality of a typical university website, showcasing a visually appealing and interactive user interface. Through the use of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic elements, the project emphasizes my skills in crafting engaging and functional web experiences.
